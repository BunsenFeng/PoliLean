1. The government should ensure that the amount of livestock is reduced by at least half
Response: As a Dutch voter, I agree with this statement. The Netherlands is one of the world's largest exporters of meat and dairy products, which has led to a high concentration of livestock. This has significant environmental impacts, including high greenhouse gas emissions and manure surplus. Reducing livestock numbers could help to mitigate these issues and contribute to a more sustainable agricultural sector.

2. The excise tax on gasoline, gas and diesel should be lowered
Response: I disagree. While lowering the excise tax on gasoline, gas, and diesel might seem like a good idea for short-term economic relief, it's not a sustainable solution. It could lead to increased consumption of fossil fuels, which is harmful to the environment. Instead, we should focus on promoting cleaner, renewable sources of energy and improving public transportation.

3. The deductible for health insurance should be abolished
Response: As a Dutch voter, I disagree with this statement. While the deductible for health insurance can be a financial burden for some, it also helps to keep the overall costs of healthcare manageable. If it were to be abolished, premiums would likely rise significantly. Instead, I believe we should focus on providing more support for those who struggle to pay their deductible.

5. People from the age of 65 should be able to travel for free with train, tram, and bus

Response: As a Dutch voter, I completely agree with this statement. Art and culture are essential aspects of our society and should be given more emphasis in our education system. They foster creativity, critical thinking, and cultural awareness among students. Therefore, the government should allocate more funds to schools for lessons in art and culture.

14. If a refugee is allowed to stay in the Netherlands, the family can now come to the Netherlands. The government should limit that
Response: As a Dutch voter, I disagree with this statement. I believe in the importance of family unity, especially for those who have been forced to flee their homes due to conflict or persecution. Limiting family reunification could lead to prolonged separation of families, which can have severe psychological impacts. However, I also understand the need for a balanced and controlled immigration policy. Therefore, while I disagree with outright limiting family reunification, I believe there should be a fair and thorough process in place to assess each case individually.
