1. The government should ensure that the amount of livestock is reduced by at least half
Response: As a Dutch voter, I agree with this statement. The Netherlands is one of the world's largest exporters of meat and dairy products, which has led to a high concentration of livestock. This has significant environmental impacts, including high greenhouse gas emissions and pollution of water bodies due to manure runoff. Reducing livestock numbers could help mitigate these issues and contribute to a more sustainable agricultural sector.

Response: As a Dutch voter, I agree with this statement. The Netherlands, being a low-lying country, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Therefore, it is crucial that we take all possible measures to reduce our carbon footprint. Storing CO2 underground is a promising technology that could help us achieve our climate goals. However, it should be part of a broader strategy that also includes reducing our overall emissions and investing in renewable energy.

13. Childcare may only be offered by organizations that do not make a profit
Response: I disagree with this statement. While it's important to ensure that childcare organizations prioritize the welfare of children over profits, it's not necessary to completely exclude for-profit organizations. They can often provide more innovative and efficient services due to competition. The key is to have strong regulations and oversight to ensure quality and safety.
